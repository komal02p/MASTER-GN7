MASTER GN7
Overview

MASTER – Antenatal AI is an AI-powered maternal healthcare support system designed to assist pregnant women, especially in rural and low-resource areas. The project aims to address challenges such as fragmented antenatal care, delayed identification of high-risk pregnancies, lack of nutrition guidance, and limited access to healthcare professionals.

Problem Statement

Maternal healthcare in rural regions remains inconsistent and reactive due to limited monitoring, poor early risk detection, and inadequate follow-up. Existing digital and AI solutions are often urban-centric, single-purpose, and difficult to use in real rural settings, leaving pregnant women without continuous and personalized maternal care support.

Solution

MASTER – Antenatal AI provides a unified platform that integrates pregnancy risk tracking, personalized diet planning, medication reminders, AI-based guidance, tele-consultation, and antenatal visit management. The system is designed to be simple, accessible, and supportive of both patients and frontline healthcare workers.

Key Features

AI-based pregnancy risk tracking

Personalized trimester-wise diet planning

Pill Box for medication and supplement reminders

AI chatbot (Janaki) for maternal health guidance

Tele-consultation with healthcare professionals

Antenatal visit scheduling and reminders

Simple, rural-friendly, and multilingual interface

AI Chatbot – Janaki

Janaki is an AI-based maternal care assistant designed to guide pregnant women throughout their pregnancy. It answers pregnancy-related questions, explains symptoms, provides basic care advice, and helps patients understand when medical consultation is required. Janaki acts as a first level of support, especially in rural areas where immediate healthcare access may be limited.

System Architecture

The system follows a client–server architecture consisting of:

Mobile application interface for patients and healthcare workers

Secure backend processing layer for AI models and decision support

Centralized maternal health database

External integrations such as tele-consultation services and notification gateways

Target Users

Pregnant women in rural and low-resource settings

ASHA workers and nurses

Healthcare professionals providing maternal care

Future Scope

Integration with wearable and IoT devices for real-time health monitoring

Support for additional regional languages and voice-based interaction
